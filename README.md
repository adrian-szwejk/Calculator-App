# **Flutter Calculator App**
This is a new, small calculator app that I plan to build while learning the basics of flutter. <br/>
**I plan to create an app with buttons that will _allow you to accurately calculate numbers_ using the 4 basic math operations**

## **Visuals**
I plan to begin with the _visuals_ as I feel that they will allow me to grasp the use of flutter widgets better before including some basic math operations into the buttons. <br/>
There will also be formatting tools like the addition of **special characters for operations like _powers and roots_**. 

### Math
Lastly, I plan to implement all the parts of a calculator that will allow you to, well, calculate.
