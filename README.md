#**Flutter Calculator App**
This is a new, small calculator app that I plan to build while learning the basics of flutter.
**I plan to create an app with buttons that will _allow you to accurately calculate numbers_ using the 4 basic math operations**

##**Visuals**
I plan to begin with the _visuals_ as I feel that they will allow me to grasp the use of flutter widgets better before including some basic math operations into the buttons. 
I plan to use formatting tools as well as **special characters for operations like _powers and roots_**. 

###Math
Lastly, I plan to implement all the parts of a calculator that will allow you to, well, calculate.
